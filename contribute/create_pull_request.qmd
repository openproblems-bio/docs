## Step 1 Merge upstream repository

Before you contribute your changes need to merge the upstream main branch into your fork. This ensures that your changes are based on the latest version of the code. 

To do this, enter the following commands adapted from [Syncing a Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork#syncing-a-fork-branch-from-the-command-line) in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/openproblems-bio/openproblems-v2.git
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
```

### Github Actions

Whenever a Pull Request (including draft) is created a github worklfow will perform checks. These checks need to be succesfull as a minimum requirement before a merge can be done.
When there are errors in the checks, try to fix them while waiting on a review. If it is not possible to fix the error, add a comment to the PR to let the reviewers know.
