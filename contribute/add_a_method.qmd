{{< include ../_blocks/_clone_repo.qmd >}}

OpenProblems has been build with Viash components including the methods of a task. A Viash component consists of a script and a Viash config. The config defines the documentation, input/output arguments and dependencies of the script. This page describes how to add a method to an existing task.

:::{.callout-tip}
Make sure you have followed the ["Requirements"](requirements.qmd) and ["Getting started"](getting_started.qmd) pages.
:::

:::{.callout-note}
This guide will explain how to add a new method for the Label projection task. Every time you encounter the string `label_projection`, replace it with your task of interest.
:::

## Create a new component

Create a new Viash component by running the following command:

::: {.panel-tabset}
## Python
```bash
viash run src/common/create_skeleton/config.vsh.yaml \
  --task label_projection \
  --type method \
  --name my_method \
```

```{bash}
#| echo: false
viash run src/common/create_skeleton/config.vsh.yaml -- --task label_projection --type method --name my_method
```

This will create a new folder at `src/label_projection/methods/my_method` containing a Viash config and a script.

    src/label_projection/methods/my_method
        ├── script.py                    Script for running the method.
        ├── config.vsh.yaml              Config file for method.
        └── ...                          Optional additional resources.

## R

```bash
viash run src/common/create_skeleton/config.vsh.yaml \
  --task label_projection \
  --type method \
  --name my_method_r \
  --language r
```

```{bash}
#| echo: false
viash run src/common/create_skeleton/config.vsh.yaml -- --task label_projection --type method --name my_method_r --language r
```

This will create a new folder at `src/label_projection/methods/my_method_r` containing a Viash config and a script.

    src/label_projection/methods/my_method_r
        ├── script.R                     Script for running the method.
        ├── config.vsh.yaml              Config file for method.
        └── ...                          Optional additional resources.

:::

Change the `--name` to a unique name for your method. It must match the regex `[a-z][a-z0-9_]*` (snakecase).

## Viash config

Full documentation on the Viash configuration file is available on the [Viash documentation site](https://viash.io/reference/).

### Functionality

This section of the configuration file contains information about the metadata of the script including script specific parameters and a list of resource files. 

````yaml

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| output: asis
out = 1
with open("/home/kai/Documents/openroblems/website/documentation/_openproblems-v2/src/label_projection/methods/my_method/config.vsh.yaml") as f:
  lines = f.readlines()

for line in lines:
  if "platforms" in line:
    out=0
  
  if out == 1:
    print(line, end="")
```

````

In this section of the configuration you should focus on updating the following sections:

1. `info` - Update the general info fields `summary`, `description`, `reference`, `documentation_url`, `repository_url`.
2. `Arguments` - Uncomment this section if you need to add method-specific parameters. Remove the example and add your own arguments.

### Platform

The Platform section defines the information about how the Viash component is run on various backend platforms.

::: {.panel-tabset}
## Python
````yaml

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| output: asis
out = 0
with open("/home/kai/Documents/openroblems/website/documentation/_openproblems-v2/src/label_projection/methods/my_method/config.vsh.yaml") as f:
  lines = f.readlines()

for line in lines:
  if "platforms" in line:
    out=1
  
  if out == 1:
    print(line, end="")
```

````

## R
````yaml

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| output: asis
out = 0
with open("/home/kai/Documents/openroblems/website/documentation/_openproblems-v2/src/label_projection/methods/my_method_r/config.vsh.yaml") as f:
  lines = f.readlines()

for line in lines:
  if "platforms" in line:
    out=1
  
  if out == 1:
    print(line, end="")
```

````
:::

The most important part of this section to update is the `setup` definition that describes the packages that need to be installed in the docker container and are required for your method to run.

For more in depth ways to specify setups see [docs](https://viash.io/reference/config/platforms/docker/).

:::{.callout-caution}
Do not remove:

1. `pyyaml` package due to general unit testing done. 
2. `anndata~=0.8` python package when creating an Rscript.
:::

:::{.callout-note}
**Tip:** After making changes to the components dependencies, you will need to rebuild the docker container as follows:

```bash
viash run src/label_projection/methods/my_method/config.vsh.yaml -- \
  ---setup cachedbuild
```
<details>
  <summary>Output</summary>
```{bash}
#| echo: false
viash run src/label_projection/methods/my_method/config.vsh.yaml -- ---setup cachedbuild
```
</details>
:::


## Script file

The script has three main sections: Imports/libraries, Viash block, and Code block.

:::{.panel-tabset}

### Python

````python

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| output: asis
out = 0
with open("/home/kai/Documents/openroblems/website/documentation/_openproblems-v2/src/label_projection/methods/my_method/script.py") as f:
  lines = f.readlines()

for line in lines:
    print(line, end="")
```

````

### R

````r

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| output: asis
out = 0
with open("/home/kai/Documents/openroblems/website/documentation/_openproblems-v2/src/label_projection/methods/my_method_r/script.R") as f:
  lines = f.readlines()

for line in lines:
    print(line, end="")
```

````

:::

### Packages/libraries

In the top section of the script you can define which packages/libraries the method needs. If you add a new or different package add the dependency to `config.vsh.yaml` in the `setup` field (see above).

### Viash block

This optional code block exists to facilitate prototyping so your script can run when called directly by running `python script.py` (or `Rscript script.R` for R users). 

Here, the `par` dictionary contains all the `arguments` defined in the `config.vsh.yaml` file. Including those from the defined `__merge__` file. 

When adding a `argument` in the `par` dict **also** add it to the `config.vsh.yaml` in the `arguments` section.

### code block

The code block will typically consist of reading the input files, performing some preprocessing, training a model on the train cells, generating predictions for the test cells, and outputting the predictions as an AnnData file.

Depending on the task, the output is stored in different locations in the anndata. e.g. for `label_projection` it is located in the `.obs["label_pred"]` and for `dimensionality_reduction` it is stored in `.obsm[X_emb]`. You will be able to find this information in the `anndata_*.yaml` file determined in the `output` argument of the `comp_method.yaml` file.

For the `label_projection` this will be `anndata_predictions.yaml`.


## Testing

Check out the in depth documentation [here](run_tests.qmd).

You can test your method by using the following command:

```bash
viash test src/label_projection/methods/my_method/config.vsh.yaml
```
<details>
  <summary>Output</summary>
```{bash}
#| echo: false
viash test src/label_projection/methods/knn/config.vsh.yaml
```
</details>

There is a general unit test that you can find in the `comp_method.yaml` that will be executed. 

Depending on the result you will get a notification on how many tests succeeded:

```text
SUCCESS! All 1 out of 1 test scripts succeeded!
```

## Final steps

Add yourself to the `task_name/api/authors.yaml` file.

When you are finished with your component create a Pull Request according to the instructions [here](create_pull_request.qmd).
