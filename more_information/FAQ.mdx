## How can I add an external resource to my Viash component?

It is possible to add additional resources such as a file containing
helper functions or other resources. All you need to do is list those
files under the `functionality.resources` section of your component and
refer to them in your script using
`meta["resources_dir"] + "/myresource.txt"`. Please visit the Viash
documentation for concrete examples on how to add [helper
functions](https://viash.io/guide/component/use-helper-functions.html)
and [other
resources](https://viash.io/guide/component/add-resources.html) to your
component.

## What does `__merge__` do?

The `__merge__` field is used to merge another YAML into a Viash config.
One of its uses is in making sure that all of the components in a task
has the same API.

Each task in OpenProblems contains strict definitions of the
input/output file interface of its components and the file formats of
those files. These interfaces are stored as YAML files in the `api`
subdirectory of each task.
