Below is a list of common Viash commands to develop and test components.
Check out this [Cheat sheet](../more_information/cheat_sheets.qmd) to
get a printable version of the same information. Please visit the [Viash
guide](https://viash.io/guide) or [reference
documentation](https://viash.io/reference/) for more in-depth
information.

:::important

Most of the common commands are added to a script in the `scripts`
directory. You can run these scripts from the root directory of the
project. Some scripts might need some additional arguments, which you
can find in the script itself.

:::

## Download test data

This command will download the all of the test resources from the S3
bucket and store them under `resources_test/`.

```bash
scripts/create_datasets/test_resources.sh
```

## Build all components

Build all components in a namespace.

```bash title="scripts/project/build_all_components.sh"
viash ns build --parallel
```

## Build all docker containers

Build all docker containers.

```bash title="scripts/project/build_all_docker_containers.sh"
viash ns build --parallel --setup cachedbuild
```

## Test a component

Test one component:

```bash
viash test path/to/config.vsh.yaml
```

Run all tests in a task:

```bash title="scripts/project/test_all_components.sh"
viash ns test --parallel
```

## Edit script

This command will auto-generate the `VIASH START`–`VIASH END` codeblock
in your script:

```bash
viash config inject path/to/config.vsh.yaml
```

## Run a component

Display the help text of a component.

```bash
viash run path/to/config.vsh.yaml -- --help
```

Run a component with arguments:

```bash
viash run path/to/config.vsh.yaml -- --input dataset.h5ad --output output.h5ad
```

## View Dockerfile

Use this command to view the component’s Dockerfile.

```bash
viash run path/to/config.vsh.yaml -engine docker -- ---dockerfile
```
