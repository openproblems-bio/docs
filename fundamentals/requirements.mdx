To start contributing to OpenProblems, you need to have the following
software installed:

-   Bash (\>= 3.2)
-   Java Development Kit (\>= 11)
-   Docker
-   Viash (\>= 0.9.0)
-   Nextflow (\>= 21.04)

The following sections provide instructions on how to install each of
these tools. If you already have all of these tools installed, feel free
to skip this boring page and go to the respective page on what you want
to do either [Create component](../create_component/index.qmd) or
[Create a new task](../create_task/index.qmd).

## Step 1: install Bash

<Tabs groupId="os">
<TabItem value="Debian/Ubuntu">

Bash is already included in most Debian- and Ubuntu-based distributions.
However, if for some reason it’s not installed, open a terminal and run
the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install bash
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="RHEL/Fedora">

Bash is already included in most RHEL- and Fedora-based distributions.
However, if for some reason it’s not installed, open a terminal and run
the following commands:

```bash
sudo yum install bash
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Arch">

Bash is already included in most Arch-based distributions. However, if
for some reason it’s not installed, open a terminal and run the
following commands:

```bash
sudo pacman -S bash
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="macOS">

Bash is already included in macOS.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Windows">

You will need to install Ubuntu using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

Open **PowerShell** or **Windows Command Prompt** in administrator mode
by right-clicking and selecting “Run as administrator”. Enter the
following command to enable the features necessary to run WSL and
install the Ubuntu distribution of Linux.

```powershell
wsl --install
```

After rebooting the system, open **Ubuntu** by visiting the Windows
Start menu or by entering the `ubuntu` command in PowerShell or Windows
Command Prompt. Since Bash is already included in Ubuntu, no further
actions are needed.

instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)*

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Verify that you have Bash version 3.2 or higher.

```bash
bash --version
```

Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

## Optional: install VS Code

It is recommended to install and use VS Code as this will help with the
development of components due to the use of extensions and YAML schemas.

VS code can be downloaded from [this
page](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

There are installers available for all major operating systems, so
simply download and install the version for your system.

#### YAML extension (recommended)

This extension provides YAML validation, syntax highlighting, auto
completion and document outlining for YAML. A must have for writing and
editing Viash config files!

The OpenProblems repo has schemas that help with writing the API and
Viash config files. The extension auto detects these schemas.

You can find more recommended extensions for developing with Viash by
visiting following
[link](https://viash.io/guide/project/ide-setup.html).
